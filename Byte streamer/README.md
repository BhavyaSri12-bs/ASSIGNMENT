The Bit Vault is a secure digital storage and management module designed to reliably hold, protect, and control access to binary data. It acts as a robust data vault, ensuring stability, integrity, and controlled accessibility of stored bits for digital and embedded system applications.

Features:
Configurable Data Width – Flexible storage size (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, etc.) to fit project requirements.

Data Lock/Unlock Mechanism – Prevents unauthorized overwrite or accidental modification.

Synchronous Read/Write Operations – Ensures reliable timing and data handling.

Reset Support – Allows data to be cleared or initialized when needed.

Enable Control – Read and write operations occur only when enabled.

Compact & Scalable Design – Can be integrated into larger digital systems seamlessly.

Applications:
Secure register file for FPGA/ASIC projects

Temporary data holding for processors

Key or password storage in digital security systems

IoT devices requiring protected data handling

Digital lockers for sensitive configuration values
