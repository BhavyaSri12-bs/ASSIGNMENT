The Smart Counter is a digital counting module designed to efficiently track and display count values with intelligent control features. It goes beyond a traditional counter by offering customizable functionality, direction control, and reset mechanisms — making it suitable for a wide range of digital systems and FPGA/ASIC designs.

Features:
Up/Down Counting – Supports both incrementing and decrementing counts.

Configurable Bit Width – Flexible counter size (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit, etc.) to suit application needs.

Synchronous Reset – Provides a clean reset mechanism for consistent operation.

Enable Control – Allows counting only when enabled, saving power and resources.

Overflow/Underflow Detection – Flags when the counter exceeds or drops below its range.

Compact & Efficient Design – Optimized for FPGA/ASIC implementation.

Applications:
Event or pulse counting

Digital clocks and timers

Stepper motor control systems

Frequency measurement

Queue/people counters in IoT applications
