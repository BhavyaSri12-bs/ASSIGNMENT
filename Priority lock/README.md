The Priority Lock is a digital control module designed to manage access to shared resources based on priority levels. It ensures that the highest-priority request is always granted first, preventing conflicts and improving system efficiency. This makes it highly useful in multiprocessor systems, bus arbitration, and digital communication protocols.

Features:
Priority-Based Access Control – Grants access to the highest-priority requester.

Configurable Number of Requesters – Easily scales to support multiple inputs.

Fair Arbitration Logic – Prevents lower-priority requests from being completely starved.

Enable/Reset Support – Allows controlled operation and re-initialization.

Compact & Optimized Design – Suitable for FPGA/ASIC implementations.

Synchronous Operation – Ensures reliable timing and decision-making.

Applications:
Bus arbitration in multiprocessor systems

Shared memory or resource management

Communication channel access control

Task scheduling in embedded systems

Real-time systems requiring deterministic priority handling
