The Ring Buffer is a simple yet efficient First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure designed for digital systems. It allows continuous data flow by reusing buffer space in a circular manner, ensuring minimal memory wastage and smooth handling of streaming data. This design is especially useful for FPGA/ASIC implementations and real-time embedded applications.

Features:
Fixed Depth Storage – Default depth of 4 (configurable).

FIFO Behavior – Maintains data order: first written, first read.

Read/Write Pointers – Efficiently managed for continuous operation.

Full & Empty Flags – Prevents data overwrite and invalid reads.

Seamless Wrap-Around – Uses circular addressing for maximum efficiency.

Synchronous Operation – Reliable with clocked digital systems.

Compact & Scalable Design – Easily extendable for larger buffer sizes.

Applications:
Data buffering in communication systems

Real-time streaming (audio, video, or sensor data)

UART/Serial communication

Producer-consumer problem in embedded systems

Temporary data storage in FPGA/ASIC designs
