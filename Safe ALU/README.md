The Safe ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a robust 8-bit processor component designed to perform basic arithmetic and logical operations with built-in safety checks. Unlike a traditional ALU, this design ensures error detection and reliable outputs, making it well-suited for secure and fault-tolerant digital systems.

Features:
Supports Multiple Operations

Addition

Subtraction

Bitwise AND

Bitwise OR

2-Bit Opcode Control – Efficient selection of operations.

Safety Flags for Reliability:

Zero Flag (Z) → Indicates when the result is zero.

Carry Flag (C) → Detects overflow/underflow in arithmetic operations.

Error Handling → Prevents undefined results.

Compact 8-Bit Design – Ideal for small-scale processors and embedded systems.

Synchronous Operation – Ensures reliable timing in FPGA/ASIC implementation.

Applications:
Small-scale CPU or microcontroller designs

Educational projects for digital logic and processor design

FPGA/ASIC-based arithmetic logic testing

Error-checked computation in embedded systems

IoT devices requiring secure and fault-tolerant computation
